# ET5 Expansion
I, RNL, suck, and am being very unprofessional by writing this all in first person

## What is ET5?
What the fuck. who are you. how did you find this

## What is the ET5 Expansion?
Originally, I just wanted to add some toggleable "cheats" on the original game, which was 50% reasonable changes like no gropple penalty, and was 50% shit like "splapples OHKO every object in the game".

Then me and Janjan were like "Hey! Let's make some actual *content*!" and it became an expansion and not like. pissing about

Here's some videos I posted during development just as like. a preview I guess

## This sounds like something I'd like to participate in, what do I need to know?
- All the editing is done with Game Maker 8.1.
- We're using https://github.com/Medo42/Gmk-Splitter so that we can have actual version control. Use files-to-gm81.bat and gm81-to-files.bat to compile changes from github into something you can edit, and to expand your changes into something git can understand.
- Try to make sure whatever new stuff you add is only accessable by enabling a cheat, and the old behavior is otherwise still there. The goal is to make it so that, with no cheats enabled, we're 1:1 with the original game.
- You can add whatever you feel like adding even if it has nothing to do with what other people are doing.
- Just so you're like, in the loop: Me and Janjan are working on new little hubs with their own Worminator entries, and Cookie is working on creating levels in the main game that MNIK named but never made.
- "Cheats" is a garbage name and so is "Mods" please help by suggesting something better
