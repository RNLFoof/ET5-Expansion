        <argument kind="STRING">//Enclosing a part of a message in square brackets [] will cause the 
//enclosed string to be highlighted.

//Placing an asterisk * at the end of a message tells the code that
//the current message is the last message.

//Putting an exponent sign ^ at the end of a message followed by a number will cause the 
//next position to be at the number. If it is followed by a number, a comma, and then another number,
//then the code will open up a box for the player to choose which path to take.
//The first number is for the yes position, and the second is for the no position.

//If you surround a number by a less than sign &lt; and a greater then sign &gt;, the code will do a manual
//pause for the  specified number of steps.

//These are the actual messages.

str[5] = "No, I didn't. I never met [Aneroid.] I guess he operated independently from the other three [Bots.]"
str[6] = "That definitely sounds reasonable."
str[7] = "How many [Bots] are there?"
str[8] = "I only knew three, but apparently [Aneroid] is proof that there might be more. The three [Bots] I hung out with included [Grax, Echagon, and Uni.] Each of them played a vital role in getting [Planet Stone] off the ground."

str[13] = "[Uni] had to travel back in time in order to give [Planet Stone] time to meld together properly. Creating planets isn't exactly the easiest thing to do."

str[18] = "Never heard of it."

str[20] = "Well, [Crystal] disappeared..."
str[21] = "Umm... crap."
str[22] = "So that's why [Leaf] isn't here."
str[23] = "We need to figure out what's going on. That way we'll have a better chance of surviving whatever weird stuff happens."
str[24] = "Definitely."

str[26] = "Sure. I'll go and get [Leaf] up to speed."

str[28] = "Don't bother with [Gertrude.] She seems like she's actually TRYING to find reasons to be angry."
str[29] = "She might have lots of useful information to help us, considering she went into that tunnel. She didn't go in too deep, though."
str[30] = "I'll be figuring out how this planet even works because I'm new here."
str[31] = "Well then, I'll be transporting some of our supplies and weapons from [ARS.]"
str[32] = "Very well. Let's meet back here later. Good luck to the [Anti-Kitchen Society!]*"
