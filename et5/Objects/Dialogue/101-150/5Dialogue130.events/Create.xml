//enclosed string to be highlighted.

//Placing an asterisk * at the end of a message tells the code that
//the current message is the last message.

//Putting an exponent sign ^ at the end of a message followed by a number will cause the 
//next position to be at the number. If it is followed by a number, a comma, and then another number,
//then the code will open up a box for the player to choose which path to take.
//The first number is for the yes position, and the second is for the no position.

//If you surround a number by a less than sign &lt; and a greater then sign &gt;, the code will do a manual
//pause for the  specified number of steps.

str[8] = "Gaah, what are you talking about?!"
str[9] = "You've been too busy chasing toasters for five years to actually realize what has been surfacing this whole time?"
str[10] = "How was I supposed to know something was going to happen?! I already had enough on my hands while fighting the [Evil Toaster!]"
str[11] = "By paying attention, of course. Do you remember how [Motewolon] had the coordinates of [the Core] left in his programming?"
str[12] = "Yes."
str[13] = "I hacked [Motewolon's] programming to make sure that would happen. If it weren't for me, you would've never found the [Evil Toaster.] Do you trust me yet?"

str[24] = "Safe haven?! I can't go to a safe haven! I have to defeat the [Evil Toaster!]"
str[25] = "If you go back to [Planet Stone,] you'll end up getting purged by the [Arch Protector.] And it won't be pleasant. A fate worse than death, one could say."
str[26] = "Wait, we're leaving [Planet Stone?!]"
str[27] = "Yes."
str[28] = "Gaah! I'm scared! Can I go home?"
str[29] = "No. You must stay away from [Planet Stone.] The [Arch Protector] will reawaken soon."
str[30] = "Honestly, who is this [Arch Protector?]"
str[31] = "No one knows. It could be anyone. Regardless of who it is, the [Arch Protector] will soon rain doom on [Planet Stone] and erase every trace of the apples from there."
str[32] = "I'm starting to think you're just crazy."
