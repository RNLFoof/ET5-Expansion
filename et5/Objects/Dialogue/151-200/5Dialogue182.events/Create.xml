str[1] = "Ah! You're alive?!"
str[2] = "No, I'm not. This body is merely being possessed by me, a [Sprite,] in order to communicate with you, since [Sprites] cannot talk with you otherwise."
str[3] = "Uh, whose body are you using?"
str[4] = "This body belonged to someone who has... moved on. We don't speak of him anymore."
str[5] = "Okay then. What is it you wanted to talk to me about, random [Sprite?]"
str[6] = "Us [Sprites] want to get rid of all you apples."
str[7] = "Yeah. I kind of noticed. Why's that?"
str[8] = "Your eyes... they impair our abilities. That's why we have tried to get rid of everything's eyes in the past."
str[9] = "Well gee, sorry for using the ability to see. I've got to save the world from an [Evil Toaster]!"
str[10] = "Yes, we are very well aware of that. Meanwhile, us [Sprites] are trying to save the universe from the [Purger.] I think that's a lot more important than your silly toaster fights."
str[11] = "What? [Purger?] What is that?"
str[12] = "None of your business. We don't need you apples to get in the way more than you already have."
str[13] = "Get in the way?! I've been trying to protect my friends from toasters! That's not butting into your business at all!"
str[14] = "Oh, it is. Just your being here impairs our abilities. We're going to lose the battle against the [Purger] because of you."
str[15] = "Alright, alright, I get it. I don't know what this [Purger] thing is all about, but what can I do to help you 'save the universe?'"
str[16] = "It's simple, really. Just kill yourselves."
str[17] = "What?! We can't do that! Not after all of this time!"
str[18] = "You have to."
str[19] = "I'm not helping you!"
str[20] = "Do you know the reason why [Frank] put you through all this trouble by making you fight against the [Evil Toaster?]"
str[21] = "Aside from 'making us stronger,' no."
str[22] = "[Frank] was merely trying to prepare you to fight [Zanifer] in the case of [Zanifer] escaping. Of course, [Zanifer] has escaped from [the Beast] and you haven't been able to stop him."
str[23] = "What?! How do you know all of this?!"
str[24] = "We are [Sprites.] We know a lot about what is going on."
str[25] = "Well, [Zanifer] wasn't even in [the Beast!] It was empty!"
str[26] = "No it wasn't. He was in [the Beast] for nine years. After destroying [Aneroid, the Beast] reacted to his [Sprite Energy] and opened. As soon as [the Beast] began opening, [Zanifer] escaped. That one little crack was all [Zanifer] needed to escape."
str[27] = "How?!"
str[28] = "In terms you're able to understand, [Zanifer] was able to teleport out through the crack. That's how he escaped."
str[29] = "So what's your point with all of this?"
str[30] = "[Zanifer] has already escaped. All of you apples have failed to do what [Frank] created you to do. You no longer have any reason to exist."
str[31] = "No way..."
str[32] = "Now your existence is merely causing problems for us. Please die now."
str[33] = "We won't die!"
str[34] = "THEN WE WILL MAKE YOU DIE!*"
