// Had this exchange:
/* 
    RNL
    @MNIK Is there any particular reason you made lasers not interact with walls, and only Reverses?
    Uh, when moving, I mean
    MNIK
    less collisions to check
    ergo less lag
    RNL
    oh okay cool
*/
// and after the lag being directly acknowledged I felt weird adding the checks to the main object even though it would be negligible to check just yellow walls
// Plus this makes sure nothing in the OG levels is broken
